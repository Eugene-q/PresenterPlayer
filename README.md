# PresenterPlayer

This is a music player remotely controlled using standard clicker for presentations.

You can ajust the volume of each track, the range of playing and the fadein/fadeout time.<br>
All tracks settings can be saved in a songlist file (.sl) and loaded later.<br>
Each loaded song is copied into the 'songListName_music' folder, if it is not there yet.
When renaming a song in the list, the song file is not renamed.

- Install requirements   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run main_app.py
